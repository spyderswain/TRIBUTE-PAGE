         <p><strong>Harshad Shantilal Mehta was an Indian stockbroker. Mehta’s
            involvement in the 1992 Indian securities scam made him infamous as a
            market manipulator. Although, as reported by the Economic Times, some
            financial experts believe that Harshad Mehta did not commit any fraud,
            he had "simply exploited loop holes in the system".</strong></p>

                His early childhood was spent in Borivali, where his father was a
                small-time textile businessman.He did his early study in Janta Public
                School, Camp 2 Bhilai. A cricket enthusiast, Mehta did not show any
                special promise in school and came to Mumbai after his schooling for
                studies and to find work.
            </li>

            <li>
                Mehta completed his B.Com in 1976 from Lala Lajpatrai College, Bombay
                and worked a number of odd jobs for the next eight years.

            <h4>The Financial SCAMM</h4>
            <li>
                It was alleged that Mehta engaged in a massive stock manipulation scheme financed by worthless bank receipts, which his firm brokered for "ready forward" transactions between banks. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Mehta was convicted by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court of India, for his part in a financial scandal valued at ₹100 billion (US$1.4 billion) which took place on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
            </li>

            <li>
                The scandal exposed the loopholes in the Indian banking system and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) transaction system, and consequently the SEBI introduced new rules to cover those loopholes. He was on trial for 9 years, until he died at the end of 2001.
